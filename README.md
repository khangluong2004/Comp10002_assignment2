# Assignment 2 - COMP10002

## Acknowledgement:
All questions and initial skeleton is provided by UniMelb COMP10002 Semester 2 2023

Complete implementation of COMP10002 (passed all test cases). The aim was to build a simple automaton - a multi-branch tree that will:
1. Receive multiple "training" prompts
2. Try to predict/ complete unfinished "testing" prompts following the 
greedy path with highest frequency/ occurance in the "training" prompts

Details included in the pdf.

Test files included with test inputs, expected outputs and actual outputs
used for comparison (start with 'mytest...').
