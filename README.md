# Assignment 2 - COMP10002

Complete implementation of COMP10002 (passed all test cases). The aim was to build a simple automaton - a multi-branch tree that will:
1. Receive multiple "training" prompts
2. Try to predict/ complete unfinished "testing" prompts following the greedy path with highest frequency/ occurance in the "training" prompts
